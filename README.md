# React NBA App

A jobs page built using React with Hooks.
I'm using [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to fetch data from google sheets.
The app is adapted for large screen size as well as for mobile screen size.

Check the live demo hosted on Heroku [here](http://door2dor.herokuapp.com/).
